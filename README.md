tags: video title text mining, sentiment analysis, time series analysis

Language: R

Data source: YouTube Video Statistics from Kaggle (US market)
Target audience: YouTube bloggers, video content producers
Story: Through performing classification, sentiment analysis, text mining, time series analysis for YouTube videos, this project aims to tell a story about what factors will affect video popularity and then give practical suggestions for YouTube bloggers to produce more
attractive contents at better time points.

Key takeaways:
1. From content aspect, music, entertainment, and film &amp; animation related videos are more popular. However, there are many existing videos in music and entertainment categories, which implies the competition is fierce and innovation is expected to boost subscription.
2. Likes are obviously more than dislikes and comments especially in music, entertainment and comedy topics. Besides, the new created features such as likes rate (number of likes/number of views) show that many people will click likes after viewing the previous mentioned three topics. For bloggers in those categories, they could try to increase comments and channel discussion; while for bloggers in other
categories, higher like/view conversion rates are expected.
3. Text mining shows tages like “makeup”, “funny”, “music”, “comedy”, “food”, “news” are frequently appeared, and titles like “2018”, “video”, “trailer”, “official”, “How” are frequently appeared. Therefore, bloggers could add more attractive tags
and refine titles.
4. The month differences show that July to October is slack season of video production and views. The hour differences show that most videos are produced in the afternoon, while early morning and afternoon are two peak viewing time. Bloggers could publish more videos during July to October to gain more market shares and audience attention. In addition, bloggers could do promotions and campaigns during the viewing peak hours to gain more exposure and attention.
